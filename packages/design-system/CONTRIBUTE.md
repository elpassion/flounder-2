# TACO - design system

Project with basic components to reuse in other projects.

## TLDR

The idea behind this project is to work similar to [tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/components) meaning logicless styled components using tailwind classes. You have to manualy copy the component code and add your own logic. In theory it should allow FE developers to work when wireframes are ready. <br><br>
